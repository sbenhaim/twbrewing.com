		<h1>Short Circuit Stout</h1>
		<p>
			Short Circuit Stout is a full-bodied and roasty stout with a
			lingering sweet aftertaste. It uses 5 different malts to create a
			variety of flavors that change in the course of taking a sip. It
			falls into the13B Sweet Stout style category as identified by the
			Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP).
		</p>

		<h2>What's With the Name?</h2>
		<p>
			By definition, a short circuit is an abnormal connection between
			two nodes of an electric circuit, often resulting in overheating,
			fire or even explosion. To the Tin Whiskers crew, this is a great
			way to describe the crossover of the distinct roasted flavors from
			the malts and the sweet aftertaste from the unfermentable lactose
			added during the boil. If you really want to blow your mind, try
			it served over vanilla ice cream for a beer float!
		</p>

		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<p>
			The 1986 comedy science fiction film, Short Circuit, grossed
			$5,346,808 it's opening weekend, earning a total of $40,697,761 in
			the US Box Office.

		<h1>Flip Switch IPA</h1>
		<p>
			Flip Switch IPA is a hoppy American pale ale with a slight citrus
			aroma. It features a variety of American hops, with just the right
			amount of bitterness to match the malty base. It falls into the14B
			American IPA style category as identified by the Beer Judge
			Certification Program (BJCP)
		</p>

		<h2>What's With the Name?</h2>
		<p>
			A flip switch is a mechanism actuating the transition between open
			and closed states of an electrical circuit. Probably the most
			common example is a light switch. You know that intense bright
			light you get when you flip on a good old fashioned light bulb?
			The kind that almost blinds you until your eyes have a second to
			adjust? Well the bold hop flavor you experience in the first sip
			of a Flip Switch is kind of like that, without the blindness of
			course.
		</p>

		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<p>
			In countries prone to earthquakes, such as Japan, most light
			switches are positioned sideways to prevent the switch from
			inadvertently being turned on or off by falling objects

		<h1>Wheatstone Bridge</h1>
		<p>
			Wheatstone Bridge is a light and refreshing wheat beer with

			Minnesota honey to an American malted wheat base, the final step
			involves steeping chamomile tea. It falls into the 6D American
			Wheat style category as identified by the Beer Judge Certification
			Program (BJCP).
		</p>

		<h2>What's With the Name?</h2>
		<p>
			Invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and improved and
			popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843, a Wheatstone bridge
			is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical
			resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of
			which includes the unknown component. But don't over think this
			one, instead picture Sir Charles Wheatstone basking in the sun,
			drinking a beer and enjoying the fame and popularity that
			undoubtedly comes with popularizing someone else's invention.
		</p>

		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<p>
			While performing experiments in electricity as a teenager,
			Wheatsone ran short of the money he needed to buy copper-plates
			for building a battery. While looking at the few copper pennies he
			had left, a thought occurred, 'We must use the pennies
			themselves,' he said, and the battery was soon complete.

			Schottky Pumpkin Ale is an amber ale with a sweet pumpkin flavor.

			pumpkin and generous amounts of pumpkin pie spice, it is a great
			beer to enhance any fall meal. It falls into the 21A Spice, Herb,
			or Vegetable Beer category as identified by the Beer Judge
			Certification Program (BJCP).
		</p>

		<h2>What's With the Name?</h2>
		<p>
			This beer is an homage to German physicist Walter H. Schottky
			(1888-1976) who played a major role in developing the theory of
			electron and ion emission phenomena. The shape you see carved into
			the pumpkin on our beer labels is actually the sign for the
			Schottky diode, which is a semiconductor diode with a low forward
			voltage drop and a very fast switching action.
		</p>

		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<p>
			Schottky died on March 4, 1976 at the age of 90. His death came
			just two years after his former employer, Siemens, had begun
			commercially manufacturing Schottky diodes for microwave use.

			refreshing beer to drink year round. It falls into the 16D Bière
			de Garde category as identified by the Beer Judge Certification
			Program (BJCP).
		</p>

		<h2>What's With the Name?</h2>
		<p>
			An ampere (or amp) is a unit of electric current named after
			French mathematician and physicist André-Marie Ampère
			(1775–1836). In addition to being the father of electrodynamics,
			Ampère was an all around solid guy, described as having "great
			amiability and childlike simplicity of character." You could use
			these same exact words to describe our solid, year-round Ampere
			Biere.
		</p>

		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<p>
			Andre Marie Ampere was dogged by bad luck. His father, for
			example, was guillotined during the French Revolution and his wife
			died shortly after their marriage. On his deathbed in 1836, he
			ordered that an inscription be placed upon his tombstone: Tandem
			Felix (Happy at Last).

		<h1>The New Site</h1>
		<h2>July 20, 2012</h2>

		<p>
			We are incredibly excited to launch our website. It has taken a lot of hard work by our dedicated
			developer and designer to reach this achievement. Stay tuned as the wiki portion of the site will be
			rolling out in the next few months. Contact us if you have any comments or suggestions on the site.
		</p>

		<h1>More 20oz Pint Glasses Are In</h1>

		<h2>July 7, 2012</h2>

		We just got in another order of our 20oz pint glasses. They are $10 a piece. The money helps support
		ordering further merchandise like t-shirts that many of you have been asking for. Stop by the pilot
		brewery to get yours today.

		<h1>Funding Update</h1>

		<h2>June 28th, 2012</h2>

		We are hard at work having meetings and discussions with various potential investors to close on our
		capital needs to build our brewery. In a matter of months we have secured 25% of the funds and are
		positioning to close on the remainder by October.

		<h1>One "Devoted connection" to beer.</h1>

		<p>
			The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George
			Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in
			2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor
			degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked
			together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering
			services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being
			young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended
			various happy hours together.  It quickly became clear that
			they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with
			the science of the brewing process.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Jake</strong> and <strong>Jeff</strong> are the two
			brewers of the company who designed and honed the
			recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on
			Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few
			boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed
			countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly
			and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like
			the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that
			point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it.
			Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business
			while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side
			of the operation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>George</strong>, in the early years, was a force
			within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and
			providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material
			around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our
			beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has
			moved on to be in charge of our online presence including
			developing our own beer wiki engine.

		<h2>What's a <span class="darker">Tin Whisker</span></h2>
		<p>A Tin Whisker is is an electrical engineering term for a
			type of product fault that typically has the symptom of a short
			circuit on the printed circuit board (PCB). It is caused by a tin hair
			that would grow between adjacent pins of an integrated circuit (IC
			which are the little black parts you'll see on the circuit
			board). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whisker">Read more on Wikipedia</a></p>
