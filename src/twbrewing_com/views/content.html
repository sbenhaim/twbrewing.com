		<h1>Short Circuit Stout</h1>
		<p>
			Short Circuit Stout is a <strong>full-bodied</strong> and <strong>roasty stout</strong>
			with a lingering <strong>sweet</strong> aftertaste.  It uses 5 different malts to
			create a variety of flavors that change in the course of taking a
			sip. It falls into the <strong>13B Sweet Stout</strong> style category as identified by
			the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP).
		</p>
		<h2>How's It Made?</h2>
		<p>
			By definition, a short circuit is an abnormal connection
			between two nodes of an electric circuit, often resulting in
			overheating, fire or even explosion. To the Tin Whiskers crew, this is
			a great way to describe the crossover of the distinct roasted flavors
			from the malts and the sweet aftertaste from the unfermentable lactose
			added during the boil. If you really want to blow your mind, try it
			served over vanilla ice cream for a beer float!

		<h1>Flip Switch IPA</h1>
		<p>
			Flip Switch IPA is an award winning American Style IPA, BJCP style
			14B. This style is known for its intense hop aroma and flavor. Maris
			Otter was chosen as a base malt for the biscuity flavor it imparts
			along with other specialty grains to add color and body. American hops
			(i.e., Chinook, Warrior, Centennial, and Citra) impart bold aromas,
			flavors, and a balanced bitterness to match the malty base.

		<h1>The New Site</h1>
		<h2>July 20, 2012</h2>

		<p>
			We are incredibly excited to launch our website. It has taken a lot of hard work by our dedicated
			developer and designer to reach this achievement. Stay tuned as the wiki portion of the site will be
			rolling out in the next few months. Contact us if you have any comments or suggestions on the site.
		</p>

		<h1>More 20oz Pint Glasses Are In</h1>

		<h2>July 7, 2012</h2>

		We just got in another order of our 20oz pint glasses. They are $10 a piece. The money helps support
		ordering further merchandise like t-shirts that many of you have been asking for. Stop by the pilot
		brewery to get yours today.

		<h1>Funding Update</h1>

		<h2>June 28th, 2012</h2>

		We are hard at work having meetings and discussions with various potential investors to close on our
		capital needs to build our brewery. In a matter of months we have secured 25% of the funds and are
		positioning to close on the remainder by October.

		<h1>One "Devoted connection" to beer.</h1>

		<p>
			The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George
			Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in
			2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor
			degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked
			together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering
			services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being
			young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended
			various happy hours together.  It quickly became clear that
			they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with
			the science of the brewing process.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Jake</strong> and <strong>Jeff</strong> are the two
			brewers of the company who designed and honed the
			recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on
			Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few
			boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed
			countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly
			and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like
			the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that
			point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it.
			Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business
			while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side
			of the operation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>George</strong>, in the early years, was a force
			within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and
			providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material
			around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our
			beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has
			moved on to be in charge of our online presence including
			developing our own beer wiki engine.

		<h2>What's a <span class="darker">Tin Whisker</span></h2>
		<p>A Tin Whisker is is an electrical engineering term for a
		type of product fault that typically has the symptom of a short
		circuit on the printed circuit board (PCB). It is caused by a tin hair
		that would grow between adjacent pins of an integrated circuit (IC
		which are the little black parts you'll see on the circuit
		board). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whisker">Read more on Wikipedia</a></p>
